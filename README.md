# NodeJS Library for the Civo API

## Introduction

This is a NodeJS library for interacting with the Civo API, which was generated by the [client-haxe](https://github.com/civo/client-haxe) library.

Civo provide superfast, scalable cloud servers with a developer-friendly API â€“ moulded and shaped by their community.

## Usage

Simply include the `main.js` JavaScript file in your application.  The tests within the `test` directory give examples of how the API is called.

## Tests

Tests do exist but more are currently in development.  In order to run the tests, create an environment variable within your operating system called `CIVO_TOKEN` and populate it with your own Civo API token. Then, the tests may be run by navigating to the `/test` directory and running:

```
npm run test
```
